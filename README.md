# CollectionGame
A game implemented in Java with GUI implemented with use of Swing.

As you play the game, new creatures with different attributes periodically spawn and can be added/organized. Different creatures affect the game in different ways. There are also items that you can buy from a shop which can have varying effects on the game. 

Game is skinned as it is because there are so many existing resources available, but can be reskinned pretty easily if wanted.
